# Voyage Vault

Voyage Vault is a sleek Flutter app designed for effortless voyage expense management. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or just starting your journey, Voyage Vault is the perfect tool to keep your budget on track.

## Project overview

### Introduction

Voyage Vault is a must-have app for travel enthusiasts who want to stay on top of their expenses. The app is a one-stop-shop for managing your travel budget and ensuring that you have everything under control. From business trips to adventurous expeditions, Voyage Vault makes it easy to track all your expenses and stay within budget.

### Technologies used

The app is built using the **Dart** programming language and the **Flutter** framework. We also use **Firebase** Database to store and manage data, and **BLoC** State Management to keep the app running smoothly.
### Use instructions

Getting started with Voyage Vault is simple. Just create an account using your email address and you'll be directed to the main page. From there, you can add voyages, voyagers, and expenses. Start by adding your fellow travelers, whether it's just you or a group of friends. Then, create a voyage, set a budget, and you're ready to start adding expenses. For each expense, choose the appropriate voyager who spent the money, and Voyage Vault will keep track of who spent how much.
### Project status

I'm continuously working to improve Voyage Vault and make it the best travel expense management app on the market. The app is currently under development, and I'm planning to release it soon on the App Store and Google Play. 
Testflight can be shared upon request.
